# Document Gen

This repo was created as an easier way to have a 'source of truth' for business data used to develop software:

- generate OpenApi specis
- generate front-end user interfaces
- produce tests/validation
- ...

Quite often people use conventional tools like spreadsheets to describe software systems.

At some point, the data on those spreadsheets turns into specifications for people to build software.

This project was created so people could migrate those spreadsheets into version control, storing the underlying data as something a bit more friendly (i.e. json) so as to make it easier to write tooling which helps downstream development (e.g. converting that data into an openapi spec)

# TODO

- Drive 'input' from cache

## Nice-to-have

- Separate out Snackbard, TabBar
